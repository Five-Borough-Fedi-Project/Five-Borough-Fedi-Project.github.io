This is the homepage of Five Borough Fedi Project (5BFP), the New York-based nonprofit corporation that operates the [Masto.NYC Mastodon server](https://masto.nyc).

## About 5BFP and Masto.NYC

5BFP was founded by the original operators of the Masto.NYC
social media service in 2024. This is our mission statement:

> The Five Borough Fedi Project operates free, federated, non-commercial social media services for the residents, workers, and organizations of the New York metropolitan area.

As a non-profit corporation organized in New York State, 5BFP owns and operates Masto.NYC as an independent, volunteer-run legal entity. The organization's 501(c)(3) charitable status lets us accept tax-deductible donations from the public. All this helps us keep Masto.NYC online, stable, and funded for the long term.
