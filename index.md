This is the homepage of Five Borough Fedi Project (5BFP), the New York-based nonprofit corporation that operates the [Masto.NYC Mastodon server](https://masto.nyc).

## About 5BFP and Masto.NYC

5BFP was founded by the original operators of the Masto.NYC
social media service in 2024. This is our mission statement:

> The Five Borough Fedi Project operates free, federated, non-commercial social media services for the residents, workers, and organizations of the New York metropolitan area.

As a non-profit corporation organized in New York State, 5BFP owns and operates Masto.NYC as an independent, volunteer-run legal entity. The organization's 501(c)(3) charitable status lets us accept tax-deductible donations from the public. All this helps us keep Masto.NYC online, stable, and funded for the long term.

## Support Masto.NYC with a donation

Masto.NYC is a free public service funded by its users. If you love Masto.NYC and you can afford to help support our operations, then we would be so grateful for a gift of any size using one of the methods listed below.

All donations help us pay for the various services that Masto.NYC needs to stay online and stable. A public Mastodon server isn't cheap to run, and our costs only rise as our usage grows. We do rely on the generosity of our user community to make sure that we can continue to deliver Masto.NYC as a fast, reliable service.

Donations by U.S. citizens are tax-deductible
in most cases!

### Make a donation online

To make a one-time or repeating donation using a credit card, Apple Pay, or bank withdrawal, [visit our donation page at Give Lively](https://secure.givelively.org/donate/99-2048115).

While we are grateful for gifts of any size, we especially appreciate monthly donations. They do a lot to help us plan how much money we can spend on server costs and other expenses month-to-month. 

### Use corporate matching

If your employer supports a donation-matching program for charitable gifts, or even provides an annual stipend expressly for donations, then you might be able to use this program to donate to 5BFP and Masto.NYC. Check your corporate donation program's charity list for "Five Borough Fedi Project".

### Mail us a check

You can also just mail us an old-fashioned on-paper check, drawn on a U.S. bank:

Five Borough Fedi Project<br/>
93 4th Ave.<br/>
PO Box 1323<br/>
New York, NY 10003

Make the check payable to Five Borough Fedi Project, Inc. We don't receive a lot of paper mail, so you can also email <help@masto.nyc> to let us know that we should expect your gift!
