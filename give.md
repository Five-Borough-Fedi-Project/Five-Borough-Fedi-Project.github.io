## About Five Borough Fedi Project

Five Borough Fedi Project was founded by the original operators of the Masto.NYC
social media service in 2024. This is our mission statement:

> The Five Borough Fedi Project operates free, federated, non-commercial social media services for the residents, workers, and organizations of the New York metropolitan area.

As a non-profit corporation organized in New York State, Five Borough Fedi Project lets Masto.NYC be owned and operated by an independent, volunteer-run legal entity, rather than relying on the time and resources of any particular individual. Its charitable status also facilitates public donations. All this helps us keep Masto.NYC online, stable, and funded for the long term.

Five Borough Fedi Project is registered in the United States as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. Our EIN is 99-2048115. Gifts from U.S. citizens are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.
