### Use corporate matching {#matching}

If your employer supports a donation-matching program for charitable gifts, or even provides an annual stipend expressly for donations, then you might be able to use this program to donate to 5BFP and Masto.NYC. Check your corporate donation program's charity list for "Five Borough Fedi Project".

### Mail us a check {#mail}

You can also just mail us an old-fashioned on-paper check, drawn on a U.S. bank:

Five Borough Fedi Project<br/>
93 4th Ave.<br/>
PO Box 1323<br/>
New York, NY 10003

Make the check payable to Five Borough Fedi Project, Inc.

We don't check our paper mailbox regularly, so if you do mail us a check, please do email <help@masto.nyc> as well, to let us know that we should expect your gift!
