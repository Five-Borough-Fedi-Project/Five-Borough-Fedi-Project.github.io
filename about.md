## Welcome, neighbors!

You’ve reached masto.nyc, a Mastodon instance based in New York City that’s open to everyone residing or working in the greater NYC area!

## Membership policy

Anyone who lives or works in the New York Metropolitan Area is welcome to create an account on masto.nyc. 

If you don’t live or work in the area, you’re still welcome to explore the site, but please don’t make an account here. This rule is enforced against blatant offenders who don’t reside in [what Wikipedia considers the New York Metropolitan Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area).

## Moderation policies

All of our moderation is driven by our server rules, listed later on this page. If you haven't read them already, please do so!

### Report rule-breaking behavior

We rely on our users to report content that conflicts with our server's rules. If you spot a post that breaks the rules of this server, please report it! This is true for both local and federated content.

### Rules enforcement for local users

If we receive valid complaints about a masto.nyc user making rule-breaking posts, then we respond according to the following general pattern:

1. The first infraction results in a warning.
1. Subsequent infractions result in temporary suspension.
1. Repeated infractions might result in permanent suspension.

We reserve the right to skip directly to suspension for egregious infractions, at the moderators' discretion.

### Blocklists and defederation

We subscribe to the [oliphant.social Tier 0 blocklist](https://codeberg.org/oliphant/blocklists/).

At the moderators' discretion, we might from time to time block additional servers as the situation warrants. We use our own server's rules as a guide for blocking servers. For example, if we receive reports about a server whose users post a lot of targeted spam with no obvious moderation, then we might block that server.

If you want to unblock a server, then please open an issue on our GitHub.

## Shutdown policy

In adherence to the [Mastodon server covenant](https://joinmastodon.org/covenant), we post public notice three months prior to any server move or shutdown events.

## Our server roadmap

This is still a really small instance, so expect some things to change as we grow.

Our current priority is to make this place a welcome home for its users. This means, in order of priority, we will be pursuing the following:

1. Reliability and uptime

1. Accessibility

1. Usability

We want to make this server into a place that our neighbors want to join, with a focus on relevant content.

And last but not least, let us know what you want out of this server!
