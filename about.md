# Five Borough Fedi Project

This is the homepage of Five Borough Fedi Project (FBFP), the New York-based nonprofit corporation that operates the [Masto.NYC Mastodon server](https://masto.nyc).

## About FBFP and Masto.NYC

Five Borough Fedi Project was founded by the original operators of the Masto.NYC
social media service in 2024. This is our mission statement:

> The Five Borough Fedi Project operates free, federated, non-commercial social media services for the residents, workers, and organizations of the New York metropolitan area.

As a non-profit corporation organized in New York State, FBFP lets Masto.NYC be owned and operated by an independent, volunteer-run legal entity, rather than relying on the time and resources of any particular individual. Its charitable status also facilitates public donations. All this helps us keep Masto.NYC online, stable, and funded for the long term.

FBFP is registered in the United States as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. Our EIN is 99-2048115.

## Support Masto.NYC with a donation

[Masto.NYC](https://masto.nyc/about) is a free public service funded by its users. If you love Masto.NYC and you can afford to help support our operations, then we would be so grateful for a gift of any size using the form on this page, or one of the alternate methods described below.

Donations by U.S. citizens are tax-deductible
in most cases! All gifts are handled by Five Borough Fedi Project, the New York-based charitable nonprofit that owns and operates Masto.NYC. All donations help us pay for the various services that Masto.NYC needs to stay online and stable.

### Make a donation online

To make a one-time or repeating donation using a credit card, Apple Pay, or bank withdrawal, fill out the form on this page. Your payment is processed by GiveLively and Stripe. One hundred percent of your online donation goes to Five Borough Fedi Project for the operation of Masto.NYC.

While we are grateful for gifts of any size, we especially appreciate recurring donations. They do a lot to help us plan how much money we can spend on server costs and such month-to-month. 

### Use corporate matching

If your employer supports a donation-matching program for charitable gifts, or even provides an annual stipend expressly for donations, then you might be able to use this program to donate to FBFP and Masto.NYC. Check your corporate donation program's charity list for "Five Borough Fedi Project".

### Mail us a check

If you'd prefer, you can also just mail us an old-fashioned on-paper check, drawn on a U.S. bank:

Five Borough Fedi Project<br/>
93 4th Ave.<br/>
PO Box 1323<br/>
New York, NY 10003

Make the check payable to Five Borough Fedi Project, Inc. We don't receive a lot of paper mail, so you can also email <help@masto.nyc> to let us know that we should expect your gift!
