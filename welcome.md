## Hello, neighbor!

We’re very happy to have you join us at Masto.NYC.

This page helps you get started with your new account, and provides some information about the server.

## Fill in your profile and discover your first follows

[The front page of fedi.tips](https://fedi.tips) includes a Quick Guide for getting started with a new account on a server like Masto.NYC. If you’re new to Mastodon or the Fediverse, please give it a read!

By choosing Masto.NYC as your server and setting up an account, you’ve already completed the first couple of steps. Next, you should fill out your profile, and then find some initial accounts and hashtags to follow.

We recommend [the `#NYC` hashtag](https://masto.nyc/tags/NYC), for starters! You can also follow [@warren](https://masto.nyc/@warren), the official Masto.NYC news-and-announcements account.

When you’re ready to say hello to your neighbors—and to the larger Fediverse—make an introductory post and tag it with `#introduction`!

## Learn about our server

The short [Masto.NYC About page](https://masto.nyc/about) covers the rules we expect our users to follow, the policies that we administators abide by, and a collection of links to other resources. Please review them to get familiar with how things work around here!

You may want to bookmark the [Masto.NYC status page](https://status.masto.nyc). It provides a running summary of the server’s health, and you can always check it for updates in the event of an outage.

## Ask for help or give us suggestions

The administrators of Masto.NYC really do want to make you feel welcome on our server. This is a project driven by our love of New York and our shared community, and we would be very happy to answer any questions or hear any suggestions you have about this server, or the Fediverse in general.
